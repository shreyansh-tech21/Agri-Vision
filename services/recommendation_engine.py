Agri-Vision Recommendation Engine
==================================
Context-aware, rule-based crop treatment recommendation service.
Provides structured agricultural guidance based on detected disease,
crop type, and prediction confidence.

Supports 6 recommendation categories per disease:
  - Treatment suggestions
  - Prevention tips
  - Irrigation guidance
  - Organic control methods
  - Chemical/pesticide category suggestions (generic, no brand names)
  - Severity-level advice

Designed to be modular and easily extendable to new crops and diseases.
